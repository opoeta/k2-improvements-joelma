# K2 Plus installer bootstrap — run on the USER'S PC, not on the printer.
#
# Usage:
#   sh bootstrap.sh <printer-ip> [<password>]
#
# Single command for every user. Behavior is auto-detected:
#   - 1.1.5.2 firmware (fresh or update)        -> erondiel/k2-improvements
#   - 1.1.3.13 firmware, no existing install    -> Jacob10383/k2-improvements
#   - 1.1.3.13 firmware, existing Jacob install -> ASK whether to add only
#                                                  extras (KAMP, surface-
#                                                  selection-wrapper,
#                                                  cartographer-macros, etc.)
#                                                  on top, or re-run the

#
# Extras-only mode (chosen automatically or via --extras-only) clones to
# /mnt/UDISK/k2-improvements-extras/ as a sibling so the existing install
# at /mnt/UDISK/k2-improvements/ is never touched.
#
# Power-user override flags (rarely needed, both skip the auto-detect prompt):
#   --extras-only   force extras-only mode regardless of detected state
#   --full          force full install regardless of detected state
#
# Idempotent — re-run any time to update.

ERROR: bootstrap is being piped from a download tool ("curl ... | sh"
or "wget -O - ... | sh"), but the self-rewrite to a temp file failed
(neither curl nor wget was found, or the re-download didn't work).

On systems with the dropbear SSH client (BusyBox / K2 Plus printer
shells) and without sshpass, the curl-pipe invocation causes silent
script termination during the SSH password prompt. The fix is to run
this script from a file instead of stdin.

Try:

  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erondiel/k2-improvements/main/bootstrap.sh \
    -o /tmp/bootstrap.sh
  sh /tmp/bootstrap.sh <printer-ip>

usage: sh bootstrap.sh <printer-ip> [password] [--extras-only|--full]

Single command for every user. Bootstrap auto-detects firmware and
existing-install state and does the right thing — no flag needed for
the common cases.

Override flags (rare, both skip the auto-detect prompt):
  --extras-only  Force extras-only mode. Clones to /mnt/UDISK/
                 k2-improvements-extras/ and shows only KAMP / Extras
                 / Status / Update in the menu. Useful for CI or for
                 advanced users who know they want this.

  --full         Force full install. Skips the auto-detect prompt and
                 re-runs the firmware-routed flow. Useful if you want
                 to reinstall over an existing install.

  --test-jacob   Test mode: simulate a 1.1.3.13 printer with an
                 existing Jacob10383 install (staged in /tmp). Forces
                 local-mode (no SSH), forces PRINTER_FW=1.1.3.13,
                 stages a fake Jacob install at /tmp/k2-test-jacob/,
                 redirects clone destination to /tmp/k2-test-extras/,
                 skips destructive operations (Entware install, opkg,
                 unslung hook), and exits after the routing decision.
                 Useful for verifying the auto-detect prompt + extras-
                 only routing without a real 1.1.3.13 printer.

  --auto-launch  Skip the post-install "Launch the menu now? [Y/n]"
                 prompt and exec the menu directly. In local-mode the
                 menu runs in the current shell; in SSH-from-PC mode
                 bootstrap opens an SSH session to the printer with
                 a TTY allocated for the menu. Useful for one-shot
                 install-and-go workflows.
